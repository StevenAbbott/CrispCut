# CrispCut

I can't believe there isn't a better option when it comes to making light video edits on Windows. Everything out there is either gimicky, looks like its going to give you a virus, or comes behind a rediculous pay wall. This is such base-level functionality it should be free. So, I'm making CrispCut.

Ideally, CrispCut will also serve as a more capable tool for ground truth image labeling. Labelme and LabelImg are ok, but it would really be nice to have something a bit more comprehensive and flexible.
